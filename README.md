This one of the projects I was working on with the help of frontend mentor

### How i managed to solve some of the issues when putting this site together ###

- fix the issue where the inline h4 element stretches to 100% in the parent container by using 'width: fit-content;
- set the the height of the card to auto to make everything fit
- set the line height for the h6 text in the profile pic div to 3px 
- change the both width and height to 35px

- This is for when a cursor is hovered over the card. the h1 element should be the only one to change colour:

```CSS
.card:hover h1 {
Â  color: var(--Yellow);
}
```
